# Vennusign Session Handoff

Updated 2026-08-09, after Menus Milestone 1 merged.

## Current State

- Working model is **features and milestones** — read `AGENTS.md` first; the phase/track/WP workflow is retired.
- **All future tracks were cancelled by the owner on 2026-08-07** ahead of a full planning reset. Phase 13 is the final numbered phase; former Phases 14–16 are canceled, their ideas held in the unprioritized Backlog — TBD. RWP-13.06 is closed as not planned (#466), and #656–#662 are closed as `NOT_PLANNED`. The queued RWP-10.02, 11.03, 11.04, 13.04 and 13.05 packages are void as plans and survive only as history.
- Tracks 0 and 1 are complete and owner-closed. The Track 1 retrospective report sits on **PR #667 (open, unmerged)**; its process changes are already folded into `AGENTS.md`.
- **The planning reset produced the Menus feature.** Design authority: `docs/design/approved/menus/` (`decisions.md` wins conflicts). All 208 register questions are resolved in `docs/features/menus/open-questions.md`; the six-milestone plan in `docs/features/menus/milestone-plan.md` is reconciled with every answer.
- **Milestone 1 is merged.** PR #685 merged to `master` on 2026-08-09 as `cd449a3`, on 13 green exact-head checks at `2977bc3`; branch `feature/menus-m1-spine` is deleted, issue #684 closed. It was reworked five times: independent reviews #2 through #6 each returned REQUEST_CHANGES and each found real defects. All are closed, every one with a regression test verified to fail with its fix reverted.
- **Milestone 1's owner acceptance has not been re-run.** The owner directed the merge without it. `m1-acceptance-record.json` is **superseded** — signed 2026-08-08 against the authored-draft implementation, kept as history only. Milestone 2 does not start until the acceptance is re-run and recorded.
- **The save model is settled: the draft is derived, not authored** (owner decision, milestone-plan §The save model). The live rows are the working state; the screens show the last published snapshot; the draft is the computed difference. Migration 058 creates no draft table, and the legacy editor now writes through `Items`/`Placements` so no path can change a screen without a publish.
- Backlog issues #670–#683 hold the owner's out-of-scope decisions; do not silently implement them.
- Not yet approved, and inputs to any further planning: `docs/architecture/built-foundations-spec.md`, and the proposed product-surface inventory under `docs/design/proposed/` (Markdown plus a searchable HTML companion). Design references only.

## Read First

1. `docs/features/menus/milestone-plan.md` — milestones, cross-cutting rules, design follow-ups, quality gates.
2. `docs/features/menus/open-questions.md` — recorded owner answers; they govern over older prose.
3. `docs/design/approved/menus/README.md` + `decisions.md` — the design authority.

## Exact Next Action

1. **Re-run the owner acceptance workbook for Milestone 1 and record the result.**
   Start the local environment with `scripts/start-ui-test-env.ps1`, run
   `scripts/run-m1-demo.ps1` (12 checks) and walk
   `docs/features/menus/m1-demo-workbook.html` with the owner. Write the outcome to a
   fresh acceptance record; do not amend the superseded one. **Milestone 2 starts only
   after that.**
2. Standing owner decisions carried out of Milestone 1: audit record kept as is (#677),
   legacy columns kept, and the three menu capabilities to become separately grantable
   (#686).
3. The screen-conflict rule, settled 2026-08-09: a screen another menu now owns is never
   touched by a stale act, and the conflict is always named — publish leaves it alone and
   reports it, restore refuses.
4. The shelf rule, settled the same way: nothing puts a menu on a screen except a
   deliberate, ceiling-checked put-back, and nothing takes a menu off the shelf while a
   screen is still showing it. "Still on a screen" means the **published** snapshot names
   one that no other menu has since been given — not merely that an assignment row exists
   — so putting a menu away requires take off, publish, then put away. A shelved menu
   stays editable and its draft stays discardable; only a restore that would put a screen
   back is refused.

## Verification

Exact-head GitHub Actions were green at `2977bc3` — 13 checks across
`phase02-tests` and `ui-regression`, Playwright included — and that is the head
that merged. Earlier commits on the branch carried `[skip ci]` at the owner's
instruction; that no longer applies.

Local runs against real LocalDB and a running product cover what CI's standing
exception skips: unit tests, the data integration suite on a database migrated
from scratch, both UI suites, the Playwright specs and the owner demo. At the
merged head the local runs were 412 unit, 56 data integration, 109 back-office and
98 platform-operations; the Playwright specs and the demo runner were covered by
CI rather than locally.

Local execution and independent review together caught defects green CI missed,
including a phantom assignment count from PowerShell turning an empty JSON array
into `$null`, a migration-script list test failing since script 052, a publish that
recorded a shipped set from a different reading of the menu than the snapshot it
committed, a torn read of the published snapshot and its version, and a menu that
could be shelved with its take-off still pending — leaving a screen showing content
no remaining act could clear. Every one is fixed with a regression test **verified
to fail with its fix reverted**; that check is part of closing a finding, not an
optional extra.

## After Milestone 1 — a retrospective item the owner named

Five consecutive independent reviews (#2 through #6) each found real defects in
work that had just been declared finished, and the throughline is consistent: the
tests written with a fix prove the case its author had in mind and stop there,
rather than attacking the next step in the sequence — publish twice, assign a
put-away menu, change only the letter casing, shelve a menu between a take-off and
the publish that carries it. Review #6 is the sharpest instance: the trap it found
was written up as a *passing test*, which asserted the refusal it hit and never
asked what the screen was still showing. Reviews are catching what the author's own
tests do not. **Decide what to change about how work is verified before it goes to
review** — owner instruction, to be taken up once M1 merges, not during it. M1 has
now merged, so this is live.

## Boundaries

- Do not start milestones 2–6 until milestone 1's demo is accepted by the owner. The merge is done; the acceptance is not.
- Do not revive any cancelled track, phase or void work package without fresh owner approval.
- Do not implement backlog issues #670–#683 without owner scheduling.
- Design follow-ups (milestone-plan §Design follow-ups) must be resolved before the milestone that consumes them.
